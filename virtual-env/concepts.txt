# source .venv/bin/activate : activating a virtual environment
# checking : which python
# desctivating the virtual env : deactivate , we can use this command wherever we are , when activating the virtual env for another project , we have to go to that directory and : ".venv/bin/activate"

# Activating a virtual environment adds its path .venv/bin (on Linux and macOS) 
# before activating the PATH variable looked like : "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
#that means the system would look for programs in : "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"

# after activating venv , the PATH variable would be : "/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
# So, when you type python in the terminal, the system will find the Python program in
# : "/home/user/code/awesome-project/.venv/bin/python" and use that one

# locking : being able to run your project in production exactly the same as in your computer while developing.


INCASE OF ERROR: 

1. This error is happening because your terminal is running the fastapi command from Anacondaâ€™s global environment, not from your virtual environment, even though it appears you're in the .venv.

2. Run fastapi from the virtual environment
Ensure you activate only the .venv environment and not base.


3. conda deactivate  # deactivate Anaconda base if it's active
source .venv/bin/activate  # activate your virtual environment only
